This requires you use IE 7, IE 8, or IE 9 on a local server and to publish a few files found in the "server_files" directory onto a server running PHP.  This is not compatible with IE 10.  You will also need to obtain a YouTube API key: http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/.

Compile youtube_jukebox.au3 and then run youtube_jukebox_server - you will then be able to use any device on the local network to scan a QR code and begin queueing up YouTube videos to play.  The limit of users, search result, count, queue length, along with other settings can be adjustable and are found in the jukebox-settings.ini file.  Also, this can be made internet accessible by setting the Local variable to NO in the jukebox-settings.ini file.
